# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis ( TABLEAU PROJECT)

## Overview

Cyclistic is a popular bike-share company in Chicago with a mission to maximize the usage of its bike fleet. As a part of the marketing analysis team, this project aims to understand the usage patterns of casual riders and annual members, providing data-driven insights to help convert casual riders into loyal, annual members.

## Project Objective

The director of marketing has emphasized the importance of increasing annual membership conversions for sustained growth. This analysis dives into the behaviors and trends of Cyclistic's users, aiming to craft a targeted marketing strategy based on solid data insights.

## Data Analysis

We utilized Cyclistic’s historical bike usage data, which includes:

- Geo-location tracking of 5,824 bicycles
- Usage data from 692 docking stations across Chicago

The analysis focuses on distinguishing the usage patterns between two customer types:

- Casual riders (users with single-ride or full-day passes)
- Annual members

## Methodology

The project followed these analytical steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Aggregated data from Cyclistic’s internal databases.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Ensured quality and consistency in the data for accurate analysis.
3. **Data Segmentation**: Differentiated between casual riders and annual members.
4. **Exploratory Analysis**: Used statistical methods to uncover usage trends and patterns.
5. **Visualization**: Developed professional visualizations in Tableau to illustrate our findings effectively.

## Key Findings

- *Difference between permanent and casual members in number is only 10%. Members tend to use the Bicycle for shortest distance and for shortest time.
- During the weekend casual rider’s use the bicycle most.
